# yepnope
A 'fork' of [yepnope](http://yepnopejs.com), continuing on what was discontinued.

Internally we were having some issues on what worked with yepnope 1.5.4.  There were times when it didn't load things in the right order or other things were timing out, breaking our page.  So I went through as a practice and rewrote yepnope in ES6. The source is here as well as a build of it in ES5 using [Babel](http://babeljs.io)

There is still some extended testing that needs to be done on this for cross browser support.
